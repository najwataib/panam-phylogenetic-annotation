PANAM makes it possible to analyse a large dataset of 18S rRNA in a simple and rapid way. It assigns taxonomy to reads generated by next generation sequencing technologies or to near-full-length sequences, and permits to define environmental clades.
A readme file text that contains instructions to set up PANAM is available in the package.
